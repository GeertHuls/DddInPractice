# DDD in practice

Experimental app supposedly to be used in vending machines, built with DDD principles in mind. 

DDD's main goal is building software which is well structured, easy to understand and adopt according to newly gained domain insights.
A strategy to accomdate this design is by leveraring a cohesive collaboration between value objects, entities, aggregates, aggregate roots and bounded contexts amongst others.

Basically this is just an attempt to learn how to properly model software.
